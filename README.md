CSE102 is an in-depth C programming course that serves as a prerequisite for over 10 other courses. It provides a detailed understanding of C programming concepts. Throughout the course, weekly assignments are given to reinforce learning.

This repository contains explanations and necessary files for each of the weekly assignments I've completed. These assignments have played a significant role in deepening my understanding of the material. You may need to obtain official permission from my faculty before using the ideas.
